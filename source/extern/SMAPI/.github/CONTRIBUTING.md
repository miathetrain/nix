Do you want to...

* **Ask for help or report a bug?**  
  Please see 'get help' on [the SMAPI website](https://smapi.io) instead, don't create a GitHub
  issue.

* **Submit a pull request?**  
  Pull requests are welcome! If you're submitting a new feature, it's best to discuss first to make
  sure it'll be accepted. Feel free to come chat [on Discord](https://smapi.io/community).
  
  Documenting your code and using the same formatting conventions is appreciated, but don't worry too
  much about it. We'll fix up the code after we accept the pull request if needed.
